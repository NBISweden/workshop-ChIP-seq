1. What is the method called where cells are repeatedly split up into wells, labeled with part of a barcode and pooled again?
a) Drop-seq
b) single-cell combinatorial-indexing *
c) SMART
d) SCRAM
	
2. What is the most common number in a scATAC-seq count matrix?
a) 0 *
b) 1
c) 2
d) 3
	
3. What was the problem with the early single cell ChIP-seq methods?
a) Too much noise in repeat regions
b) Too many reads that would not align to the genome
c) Too much starting material required
d) Too few reads per cell *
	
4. There is a nice new single cell method from 10X Genomics available, where you can measure several types of data from the same cells. Which data?
a) RNA and TF binding
b) TF binding and DNA methylation
c) DNA methylation and open chromatin
d) open chromatin and RNA *

5. What are anchors in the data integration method used by Seurat?
a) Clusters of cells
b) Pairs of similar cells from the same data set
c) Pairs of similar genes, from the same data set
d) Pairs of cells, from different data sets, that are mutual nearest neighbors *

6. Why are unsupervised methods useful?
a) Because they are fast
b) Because they can show you unexpected patterns in data *
c) Because they can handle large data sets
d) Because they can handle missing values

7. What does the command “reduce(peaks + 100)” do when you use the GRanges package in R?
a) Select the top 100 peaks, and select all peaks that don’t overlap with any other peak
b) Add 100 random peaks, and collapse all overlapping peaks
c) Extend all peaks 100 bp in each direction, and collapse all overlapping peaks *
d) Shift all peaks 100 bp, and select all peaks that don’t overlap with any other peak

8. What are the gene activity scores Seurat calculates based on?
a) ATAC-seq reads in the promoter regions of each gene *
b) Gene expression variability
c) The fraction of reads in peak in each cell
d) The number of cells in each cell type
